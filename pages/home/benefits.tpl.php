    <p>The drawing editor provides importing and exporting of floor plans along with creation of floor plans from ideation.
    The design stage integrates with the feedback supplied by the project members for making any improvements and suggestions on to the floor plan.
    Drawing interoperability is integrated into enscalo and is one of the most important features for users to switch between applications.</p>
    <p>The drawing editor distinguishes between bounded contexts in a quantitative manner in order to have a clear separation between the various rooms in a building.
    The access elements for each component of the floor plan required by a floor plan project is integrated into the drawing and interacts with the 
    backend provided by enscalo.</p>
    <p>Basic shapes and drawing elements such as circle, rectangle, line and points are supported within the software. Off the shelf solutions for drawing blocks
    with their SVG counterparts are available within enscalo. Customised drawing blocks are provided within enscalo which make the product intuitive and useful for 
    creating a rough sketch of a floor plan.</p>
