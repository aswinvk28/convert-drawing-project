    <p>Doors, windows and other usable blocks required for floor plans are integrated within the drawing editor and are available with different types of purpose.
    The detailing on each block describes the dimensional characteristics without any change in appearance for the block. All the drawing elements including the basic shapes
    are custom developed within the drawing editor which communicates with the backend for storage and retrieval. While printing the finished floor plan created within a workspace, 
    the points created do not appear by default. You can start your drawings using a blank template which will then load all the necessary blocks integrated with the software.</p>
    <p>The drawing editor comes with a system of grid to locate and interact with the drawing elements and a drawing panel to control and specify how well the user interacts with the editor 
    and what type of data that the user has to handle.</p>
